Hello! Welcome to the Discord Server for the Norman Working Group!

We are a group in the Oklahoma metro area focused on discussion and activism related to leftist political causes. We meet once every two weeks (fortnightly) on Sundays. Each meeting alternates between our Jacobin Reading Group and our Working Group.

During Reading Group meetings we will read articles (usually pulled from Jacobin Magazine) and discuss the ideas in the and how we might apply them to our efforts.

During Working Group meetings we will discuss activist and other work the group is engaged in, giving updates and discussing next steps.

In between meetings we chat and coordinate on this server. Feel free to chat and hangout whenever you like. Here's the overview of the channels:

========== Text Channels ==========

#announcements - This channel! It's locked and mainly so we can put stuff like this and links to important resources in an easy place where people can see. This is where we will put important stuff.

#discussion  - This channel is for on-topic discussion. Here we'll discuss leftist ideas, politics, and activism related to past meetings and anything else we might want to discuss on the topic.

#off-topic  - Obviously, we like other stuff too. Here's where you can discuss your other interests. If any particular topic gets enough love we'll create a channel just for it so let us know if you are interested in having a channel for a particular topic.

#automated-messages - This is just where the bots like to talk among themselves. Nothing to see here for humans.

========== Voice Channels ==========

Main Room - This is for large group discussions and online presence for those unable to attend an in-person meeting. 

Small Group Rooms - These are for smaller more private discussions or if we break out into small groups. They are limited to 5 people at a time.

========== Sever Rules ==========

1. Be Kind - A real leftist movement is about solidarity and compassion. 

2. Be Inclusive - While we aren't going to hardcore language-police others, be thoughtful about the language you choose to use. Any intentionally exclusionary language against groups of people will be met with disciplinary action (detailed below). 

3. Be Thoughtful - Discussing politics is hard and often requires us to question ideas and things that hold a lot of emotional weight. As a result, be open to new ideas and if a discussion gets heated take the time to step back and collect thoughts before stepping back in. Remember, solidarity should be our focus.

========== Breaking the Rules ==========

Unfortunately, there are cases where some of us might step over the line and break one of the rules outlined above. If that happens we will first attempt to educate, then be forced to take increasingly severe actions until the issue is dealt with. While every situation will be handled on it's own nuances, our general outline for disciplinary action is:

1. Warning - A message detailing  what was deemed unacceptable will be sent so that those who ignorantly break a rule can learn.

2. Timeouts - If the behavior does not improve, the person will be timed out for an escalating amount of time to be given a chance to reflect on the infraction:
        * 15 minutes
        * 1 hour
        * 1 day
        * 1 week
        * 1 month

3. Banning - While solidarity is one of our primary focuses, anyone who repeatedly refuses to be inclusive, compassionate, thoughtful, or kind will be permanently banned from the server. Our hope is that this is never necessary.

Once again, welcome to our Discord Server!  Feel free to go an introduce yourself in #discussion , we look forward to getting to know you!
